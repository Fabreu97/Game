 NOTE: This project is in transition from the names of methods, attributes, classes and objects from Portuguese to English
 
 #### Motive
  - English is an almost universal language and the C ++ language itself is in English.
  - The use of the Portuguese accent is somewhat problematic when it comes to naming a variable taking the meaning of the word in the first reading.
  
## What is SFML?
Answer: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library or SFML is a multiplatform library developed in the Object Oriented paradigm that provides all the graphic resources for the creation of various programs, for example the creation of games.
